    <strong><em><u>Profile </u></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    I am currently employed as a Cloud Architect / Developer and as well as
    previously being a Subject Matter expert in the areas of VMware and some
    Hyper-v. I am proficient in automation and cloud technologies, such as
    platforms. I have over eight years of experience scripting and tooling
    using REST, JASON, YAML, Bash, PowerShell, XML, SQL, WMI and Directory
    Services.
</p>
<p>
    I have designed and implemented fully autonomous app-centric enterprise
    level topologies, whether that be an on-premise data centre, a cloud
    provider or cloud abstraction layer.
</p>
<p>
    I have experience in both an architectural capacity and an engineering
    capacity, (capturing requirements, developing solutions and documenting
    architectures) and hands on experience: this allows me to be flexible to
    understand customer requirements and also deliver the solutions as
    required.
